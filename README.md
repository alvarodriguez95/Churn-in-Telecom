Phase 4: Alvaro Rodriguez

# Overview
For this project, we will be using logistic regression, decision tree, and knn modeling to analyze the features used to determine the churn rate of customers in SyriaTel, a Telecommunications company.

# Business Problem
![
I have been contracted by the VP of Customer Service to help improve customer churn rate and entice customers to stay at SyriaTel. SyriaTel has been losing customers in the previous months and they are eager to retain these customers. They also want to see the best predictors in retaining these customers and reducing customer churn rate.

# Data & EDA
Data regarding customer churn rate was retained from SyriaTel's database in Kaggle.com.
Database is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset).
